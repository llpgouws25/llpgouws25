# About me
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and excel in coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about data engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other coders, to be a professional at coding
- ⚡ Fun fact: I always find new business ideas. Oh and, I consider myself a beast when it comes to cooking and I'm not even a chef.
